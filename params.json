Start the stream in a Chrome browser with the cast extension installed and the cast icon will appear when Chromecast is available.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n* Tested on Mac OS X and Ubuntu\r\n* PHP enabled webserver\r\n* [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) with libx264 support\r\n* [hdhomerun_config](http://www.silicondust.com/support/downloads/)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n* Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/Logan2211/hdhomerun_hls.git`\r\n* In `html/callback.php` configure the path to `hdhrstream.class.php`\r\n* Copy `html/*` to a PHP enabled directory on your webserver. Make sure that your web server has write permissions to this directory so ffmpeg can write the stream segments here.\r\n* Configure the settings at the top of `hdhrstream.class.php`. The main options involved in the initial configuration are listed below.\r\n\t* `target_ip` should be set to the IP of the system hosting this app\r\n\t* `ffmpeg_base` must point to your FFmpeg binary\r\n\t* `stream => path` must be set to the html directory where `index.html`, `callback.php`, etc reside. This is the directory where VLC will output the m3u8 HLS playlists and transcoded video segments.\r\n\t* `num_tuners` will typically be 3 on HDHomeRun Prime, may be different on other HDHR models.\r\n\t\r\n### Advanced/Optional Settings\r\n* In `html/index.html` there are several `channel_filter_*` settings at the top of the file which enable display filtering of channels. It is disabled by default but I use this to display only HD channels.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nOnce configured navigate to the index.html URL on your device and attempt to start the stream. Check the web server error log and transcoder log file (configured in `hdhrstream.class.php`) if the stream does not start.\r\n\r\nHLS capable players are iPhone, iPad, Safari on Mac, Chromecast, VLC, etc. In the case of browsers that do not natively support HLS streaming we serve a Flash fallback HLS player.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n![Screenshot 1](http://i.imgur.com/Xz3gt5a.png) ![Screenshot 2](http://i.imgur.com/pTWCmHd.png) ![Screenshot 3](http://i.imgur.com/zWMGDS8.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
